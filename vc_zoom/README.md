# Indico Plugin for Zoom

## Features

 * Creating Zoom meetings from Indico;
 * Sharing Zoom meetings between more than one Indico event;
 * Creating meetings on behalf of others;
 * Changes of host possible after creation;
 * Protection of Zoom link (only logged in, everyone or no one)
 * Webinar mode;

## Implementation details

Rooms are created under the account of an *assistant user* which can be set using the **Assistant Zoom ID**
configuration setting. This account will also be added automatically as an assistant to every meeting host.
This is needed in order to allow for the host to be changed ([`scheduled_for`](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/meetings/meetingcreate#request-body) property in the Zoom API). The *assistant user* owns every Zoom meeting, with the `scheduled_for` property being
used to grant the required privileges to the desired hosts.

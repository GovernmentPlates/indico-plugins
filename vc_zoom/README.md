## Changelog

### 2.3b2

- Improve logging when a Zoom API request fails
- Fail more gracefully if no Zoom account could be found for a user
- Allow using the same name for multiple Zoom rooms
- Update the join url when changing the passcode
- Provide an alternative method of looking up the Zoom user corresponding to an Indico user
- Always show the full join link and passcode to event managers
- The meeting passcode can be restricted to registered participants

**Breaking change:** The email domains are now stored as a list of strings instead of a comma-separated list. You need to update them in the plugin settings.

### 2.3b1

- Initial beta release

## Implementation details

Rooms are created under the account of an *assistant user* which can be set using the **Assistant Zoom ID**
configuration setting. This account will also be added automatically as an assistant to every meeting host.
This is needed in order to allow for the host to be changed ([`scheduled_for`](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/meetings/meetingcreate#request-body) property in the Zoom API). The *assistant user* owns every Zoom meeting, with the `scheduled_for` property being
used to grant the required privileges to the desired hosts.

## Zoom App Configuration

### Webhook (optional)

**URL:** `https://yourserver/api/plugin/zoom/webhook`

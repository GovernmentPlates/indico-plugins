# Manual Payment Plugin

This plugin provides a "manual" payment option for Indico's payment module which
is typically used for payments via Bank Transfer. It allows event organizers to
define a custom text with various placeholders to provide information on how to
make a payment or even link to an external payment service that has no deeper
integration with Indico.

## Changelog

### 3.1

- Add placeholders for the registration form id and the registration's database id

### 3.0

- Initial release for Indico 3.0

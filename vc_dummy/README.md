# Dummy Videoconference Plugin

The dummy videoconference plugin is meant for developers who want to test the
videoconference management functionality in Indico without having access to an
actual videoconference service supported by Indico.

It's only intended for developers and thus it is not included when installing
plugins via the `indico-plugins` meta package.

## Changelog

### 3.1

- Adapt to Indico 3.1 changes

### 3.0

- Initial release for Indico 3.0

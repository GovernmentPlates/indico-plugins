# Piwik Plugin

The Piwik plugin allows integrating Indico with a Piwik instance to gather
statistics about the users accessing Indico or specific Indico events.

Please note that the plugin has not been tested with Piwik's successor,
Matomo, so we do not know whether it is compatible with it or not.

## Changelog

### 3.0

- Initial release for Indico 3.0
